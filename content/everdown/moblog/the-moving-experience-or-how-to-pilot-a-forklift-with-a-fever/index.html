    It all started Wednesday 7/22. That day I decided to relax before the storm, and I didn't really do anything. It was fine.

     Packing. Lots of packing. I slept in like usual, then woke up and got off to a tepid start. Without any momentum it was difficult to start, but after breaking out a box and unloading a single shelf into it things got moving. There were occasional bits of friction, but for the most part I maintained pace and got a good bit packed. I also got my first experiences of The SLO Disappearing Trick. I moved my two large couches onto the side of the street, and within three hours they were gone. I give the day a 7/10, but I was surprisingly tired.

     More Packing. More things went into boxes, I got the living room all packed up, and pulled some more magical disappearing tricks with other large items like bookshelves. Packing continued until the early evening. Previously I had worked out logistics with my father and they dictated I got to my parents house with my packed motorcycle that night. I spent until the late evening getting my motorcycle gear together, noticing that I needed to drop off a

     to the north. My sister arrived, gave me some carrot cake, we talked about cats, then I was off around 7:30pm. I'd been tired this day too, my roommate was sick and I thought I must have been fighting it off.

     I drove north 30 minutes, and started to feel subpar. Dropped off the book, and started the 3 hour ride back south. I began to feel worse, and worse, and worse. My health rating was monotonically decreasing and I was not happy about it. I began to get cold an hour in, and I pulled over and put on the liner to my jacket. That kept me cozy until the shivering started. Have you ever been sweaty and shivering at the same time? It's no fun.

     Eventually I managed to get home at 11pm, though how I made the last few miles is a mystery. Turns out I had a fever of 101

      Â°. After struggling a burrito down I passed out to a night of hot sweats, cold sweats, and odd dreams.

     Saturday 7/25 - The day of heck (And forklift!)

    <span style="font-size: 14px;">
     I woke up marginally early and drive 2 and a half hours back north with my dad a truck and a trailer, then began loading. I was feeling chipper considering, though my dad's comment of "I was expecting you to be more packed" left me feeling a little sad. We scrambled to load the truck and trailer while I tried to finish packing and we got most of everything in the truck.

     We left 30 minutes apart since I had errands to run, and with nothing better to do I figured out how long it would take to catch up. He would be going 55mph with a trailer, I was going 70mph. 30 minutes at 55 is a bit more than 25 miles, and with a closing speed of 15mph that meant a bit under 2 hours. Lo and behold, a bit under 2 hours later I caught up! Then spent the next two hours in
